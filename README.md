**Dynamic Vehicle Search Filter**
This code creates a dynamic vehicle search filter that allows users to refine their search by selecting criteria such as brand, year, price range, doors, transmission type, and color. The results are updated in real-time based on the selected criteria.

**Code flow:**

- Create year selection and charge the DB
- Detect changes in filter inputs (brand, year, price range, etc).
- Apply all filters sequentially to the autos array.
- Display the result filtering previous results.
  - Show an error message if no matches are found.
